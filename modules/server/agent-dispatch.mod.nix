# Agent-fleet dispatcher. See docs/agent-fleet.md. Turns the fleet into a
# drop-a-file service: a task is a markdown prompt placed in the queue
# directory; a worker runs it on a pristine VM and the report comes back —
# no SSH into guests, no forge in the loop.
#
#   /var/lib/agents/tasks/queue/<name>.md   <- tasks land here, enqueued by the
#                                              `fleet` tool run as the operator
#                                              user (see fleet-tool.mod.nix); the
#                                              queue is operator-owned, not
#                                              wheel-writable
#   /var/lib/agents/tasks/done/<id>/        <- prompt.md + report.md + agent.log
#   /var/lib/agents/tasks/failed/<id>/      <- same, for nonzero exit or timeout
#   /var/lib/agents/tasks/rejected/         <- quarantined non-regular queue entries
#
# Scheduling: one resident drainer per roster worker maintains a fresh warm VM,
# atomically claims queued tasks, and delivers each prompt into an already-live
# guest. After one task it stops the VM, safely archives bounded output, wipes
# the writable volumes, and boots a fresh idle replacement.
